## Overview <a name="Overview"></a>

Career advancement through promotion, recruitment, grant awards, and research evaluation procedures is repeatedly mentioned as one of the key incentives for researchers and their practices and behaviours. Nearly every conversation about changes in scholarly communication ultimately ends up at this point; in particular, highlighting research institutions that are slow to adapt to changes in modern research environments, and how the present system penalises those who innovate or adopt novel research communication styles, methodologies, and reporting outside of traditional disciplinary structures.

We want to conduct a research project to provide the data to confirm or refute the assumption that promotions criteria are comparable across the sector, and provide the basis for recommendations to help us move to a new status quo. While we recognise not everyone conforms to such criteria and guidelines, these nonetheless provide a useful indicator of what might be the cause of such behaviours, and whether or not practices are reflective of such guidelines.

Thus, our proposal is to address the following key question: what models or practices could be developed to help incentivise and reward innovation and diverse forms of scholarly communication and public engagement, while reducing the risk to those who are seen to be diverging from traditional modes of professional practices and advancement?

## Project outline <a name="Outline"></a>

* Figure out the sample and set up spreadsheets to track the data collection. 
  * Which countries? 
  * How many institutions per country? 
  * How do we categorize different types of institutions? 
  * How do we categorize the disciplines?

* Set up a project website using GitHub pages for contact information and to keep track of the project.

* Translate outreach e-mails. Set up e-mail templates and translate them. Base these off the existing [ScholComm Lab RPT Project](https://www.scholcommlab.ca/research/rpt-project/).

* Ask OpenAIRE NOADs for help collecting the documents. They are already established OA contact points in their countries.
  * Define other organisations that can help with the outreach/data collection strategy.

* Create a project dictionary. Since this project will not just use English documents, it would be useful to collect terms we would be looking for in our analysis and translate them into the different languages.
